<h3>Our history</h3>


<p>The Centre for Economic Research and Intergovernmental Co-Operation (CERI) was established in 2012 to advance inclusive, evidence-based economic research that supports sustainable development and global cooperation. From its early roots in educational research and social equity, CERI has grown into a multidisciplinary platform connecting scholars, policymakers, and institutions across sectors and borders.
<br><br>
CERI’s founding was inspired by a commitment to understanding the systemic challenges that affect human development—particularly the intersection of education, economic opportunity, and social well-being. This foundation has evolved into a broader organizational mission: to equip communities and governments with actionable insights that promote resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.
<br><br>
Today, CERI works in partnership with researchers, practitioners, and institutions to address pressing global issues in education, health, and inclusive economic development. As we continue to expand our impact, CERI remains guided by the core principles of integrity, collaboration, and the belief that policy shaped by rigorous research can transform lives.</p></div>
