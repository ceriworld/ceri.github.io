<p>The Centre for Economic Research and Intergovernmental Co-Operation (CERI) is a nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization dedicated to advancing evidence-based policy in education, health, and economic development. Operating from key locations in the United States, France, and Colombia, CERI brings together scholars, institutions, and governments to address complex global challenges.</p>

<p>Through a rigorous and integrative approach—combining empirical analysis with theoretical insight—we evaluate and inform policies, programs, and systems. Our work is made possible through the support of partner institutions and funders who share our commitment to equity, inclusion, and shared prosperity. By translating research into actionable guidance, CERI empowers decision-makers to improve outcomes for individuals, communities, and nations.</p> 

<h3>Our vision</h3>
<div class="section-divider"></div>

<p>A world where inclusive and collaborative economic policymaking drives sustainable development, strengthens human well-being, and fosters resilient, cooperative societies across borders and sectors.</p>

<h3>Our mission</h3>
<div class="section-divider"></div>

<p>CERI --- the Centre for Economic Research and Intergovernmental Co-Operation --- advances inclusive, evidence-based economic research to support sustainable development, human well-being, and global cooperation. We bridge national and institutional divides by delivering high-quality analysis, facilitating dialogue, and equipping policymakers, institutions, communities, and governments with actionable insights. Guided by equity, integrity, and collaboration, CERI promotes shared prosperity and resilience across nations and sectors.</p>

<h3>Our history</h3>
<div class="section-divider"></div>

<p>The Centre for Economic Research and Intergovernmental Co-Operation (CERI) was established in 2012 to advance inclusive, evidence-based economic research that supports sustainable development and global cooperation. From its early roots in educational research and social equity, CERI has grown into a multidisciplinary platform connecting scholars, policymakers, and institutions across sectors and borders.</p>

<p>CERI’s founding was inspired by a commitment to understanding the systemic challenges that affect human development—particularly the intersection of education, economic opportunity, and social well-being. This foundation has evolved into a broader organizational mission: to equip communities and governments with actionable insights that promote resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.</p>

<p>Today, CERI works in partnership with researchers, practitioners, and institutions to address pressing global issues in education, health, and inclusive economic development. As we continue to expand our impact, CERI remains guided by the core principles of integrity, collaboration, and the belief that policy shaped by rigorous research can transform lives.</p>
