      <description>CERI is devoted to helping institutions and governments improve social policy. We work with executive boards, organizational leaders, and other data-driven entities to fill information gaps and solve complex problems.
To achieve our goals, we build diverse research teams with a global reach. Depending on the task, our teams may include open source specialists; public policy experts; financial analysts, media and public relations specialists; marketing professionals; business and not-for-profit leaders; academics; and experts in social media analysis; as well as former elected officials, investigative journalists, government investigators, and intelligence professionals.</description>
